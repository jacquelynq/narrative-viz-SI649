    <h1>Streamlining sensor maintenance for a data-richer world</h1>
    <h2>Jacquelyn Schmidt for SI649, Winter 2024</h2>
    <p>With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, the world is developing a voracious appetite for data. Large, high-quality datasets are needed to power the insights provided by data-driven algorithms. Creating these datasets is easier said than done, however. </p>
    <p>In the world of environmental sensing, collecting data is a particular challenge. In the great outdoors, conditions are not usually favorable for the electronic sensors needed to automatically measure key variables of interest. Unlike in a laboratory or factory setting, sensors deployed outside are liable to be rained on, to be knocked out of place by wind or animals, or to be broken in a myriad number of ways. It is impossible to control for everything that could go wrong, and so <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/7/574/289294">sensor network maintenance is a never-ending task.</a></p>
    <p>That being said, sensor network maintenance is expensive. At the United States Geological Service, the nation’s foremost provider of hydrologic data, a single water gauge station costs <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190418_R45695_375a1752e786ba50ac96cf3744caee9e5fe956df.pdf">upwards of $20,000 a year in upkeep</a>. Much of this cost can be attributed to the manual labor involved in monitoring and validating sensor data, as well as sending staff out to the field to fix any issues that arise. While the demand for real-time water data is growing, at this price point, it is impossible to collect the volume of data needed to support new, high-tech programs like <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/2/570">real-time flood prediction</a>, and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.5b05870">coordinated, city-scale stormwater management systems</a>.</p>
    <p>One way to reduce the cost of environmental data is to implement <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815222000706">automated time series monitoring</a>. In other words, instead of having a human constantly checking in to make sure every sensor is working as it should, develop an algorithm capable of altering maintenance staff when a sensor breaks. The challenge then becomes, how do we automatically determine when a sensor breaks?</p>
    <p>Even sensors measuring the same variable may return time series showing a wide variety of trends. Moreover, when sensors break, the resulting noisy data may also appear different, depending on what went wrong in the field.</p>

    <p>One strategy posed by <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c00360?casa_token=aGTArlVGbsIAAAAA:-q0Z6Ndu9RY56zb1hTCHpWJPXuxc7ggIIXEH-EMgAhNtqKjfik033XXhbw5JrVcQgDChkt1DtJAiM-Q">Schmidt and Kerkez (2023)</a>, is to look at the dynamics of the sensor data.</p>
    <p>Dynamics describe how something moves, and in the natural environment, they are governed by natural processes. When measuring environmental variables, we usually expect them to change continuously and smoothly, according to the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. When an environmental sensor returns clean data, the dynamics of that data should reflect that.</p>

    <p>When a sensor breaks, however, those assumptions get thrown out the window. One of the most common ways an environmental sensor can break down in the field is due to an obstruction — something blocking the sensor’s line of sight. An ultrasonic distance sensor measuring water depth, for example, could be obstructed when something gets in between the sensor’s receptor and the surface of the water. In this case, the sensor reading will either go flat (showing no change), or it will bounce between taking measurements of the water level and the obstructing object. </p>
    <iframe src="noisy_data_animation.html" width="100%" height="625" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>Even obstructions that might be hard to see in the time series data become glaringly obvious when looking at a plot of dynamics. This observation serves as the basis of the automated sensor fault detection algorithm presented in the paper. Reducing the cost of collecting environmental sensor data is a crucial step towards unlocking the power of artificial intelligence in societally-important industries such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental conversation.</p>
